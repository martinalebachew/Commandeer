# Commandeer 🍪
Commandeer is a C++ utility for cookie theft on Chromium-based browsers, that helps you to dump all of the user's cookies into a unencrypted file and without prompting the user for permission / asking for special privilleges! This is possible due to a [vulnerability](https://mango.pdf.zone/stealing-chrome-cookies-without-a-password) discovered by the legendary @mangopdf.

## Support
Commandeer is currently in early stages of development 🚧

In the (near) future, Commandeer will support Windows, macOS and some Linux operating systems.
Vulnerable browsers include Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera and bare Chromium.
